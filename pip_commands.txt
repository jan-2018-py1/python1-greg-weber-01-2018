pip2 commands (the assignment says pip but homebrew installed pip2 and when I try to run a pip command I get an error... maybe the course material needs to be updated.)

1. pip2 install Django 
    -didn't run - error saying not supported, I did some research and since Django was just updated and pip2 is trying to install newest 
    version (which isn't compatiable with python 2.7). After more searching on Stack Overflow I found that you can install an older version
    of Django like:
1a. pip2 install Django==1.11

    it worked!

2. pip2 list 
    outputs the following:

    click (6.7)
    Django (1.11)
    Flask (0.12.2)
    itsdangerous (0.24)
    Jinja2 (2.10)
    MarkupSafe (1.0)
    pip (9.0.1)
    pytz (2017.3)
    setuptools (38.2.5)
    Werkzeug (0.13)
    wheel (0.30.0)

3 pip2 install Django==1.11 (again)
    outputs the following:

    Requirement already satisfied: django==1.11 in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
    Requirement already satisfied: pytz in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from django==1.11)

4. pip2 freeze
    outputs similar to pip2 list, but with a few items not present and == instead of ():

    click==6.7
    Django==1.11
    Flask==0.12.2
    itsdangerous==0.24
    Jinja2==2.10
    MarkupSafe==1.0
    pytz==2017.3
    Werkzeug==0.13

5. pip2 freeze > requirements.txt
    added a requirements.txt file to my Desktop

6. looking in the requirements.txt file it shows the same info as if I had just ran the freeze command on the command line - interesting: 

    click==6.7
    Django==1.11
    Flask==0.12.2
    itsdangerous==0.24
    Jinja2==2.10
    MarkupSafe==1.0
    pytz==2017.3
    Werkzeug==0.13


7. pip2 uninstall Django 
    showed a ton of files then asked if I wanted to proceed (y/n)
    I typed y return an dit finished unistalling successfull:

    Successfully uninstalled Django-1.11

8. pip2 show Django
    nothing happens and it gives me a new command line prompt

9. pip2 search Flask
    spit out a few hundred files relating to Flask
